# Thomas-International-GIA-Test 

The Thomas International General Intelligence Assessment (GIA) is a speed test that measures your ability to quickly learn, comprehend and retain information.

The test has 5 parts:

1. Perceptual Speed
2. Reasoning
3. Number Speed and Accuracy
4. Spatial Visualisation
5. Word Meaning

The aim of this project is to provide a simple tool to train and improve your performance.

## Installation

The code has been developed and tested on Python 3.8.10 (Anaconda).

You can install with (there is some extra stuff like nltk which I am not using yet):
```
pip install -r requirements
```

Then you can run the code from the terminal:
```
python src\main.py
```

## TODO
- Fix some bugs (e.g., Number Speed and Accuracy test)
- Reasoning Test: the statement appears, then it disappears, and finally the question appears 
- Make a GUI
- Collect more examples from the GIA test
- Extend the score with the timing
- Add squared images for the Spatial Visualization test
